# Alphabet Soup Challenge
The following changes were made to the model to improve  the accuracy rate from 70.7% to 74.28%
a. Increased neurons to 96
b. Added 3 hidden layers
c. Increased # of epochs to 200
I did not dare to add more neurons or layers as my computer was having a hard time processing the model.
I'm not sure what model would perform better.
